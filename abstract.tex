{\bf Abstract:}
In this paper, a new type of range searching problem, called the 
\emph{partial enclosure range searching problem}, is considered. 
Given a set of geometric objects and a query region, our goal is 
to identify those objects which intersect the query region by at 
least a fixed proportion of their original size. Two variations 
of this problem are studied. In both the variations, we considered 
the query object $\cal R$ as an axis-parallel rectangle. In the 
first variation, the query is done among a set of line segments, 
and the objective is to report/count the objects which has at 
least a given proportion is inside $\cal R$.  In the second 
variation, the query is done for a given monotone or a convex 
polygon $\cal P$, and our objective is to report the area of 
the intersection between the polygon $\cal P$ and a query 
rectangle $\cal R$.
