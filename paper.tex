{\bf Abstract:}
A new type of range searching problem, called the \emph{partial 
enclosure range searching problem}, is introduced in this paper. 
Given a set of geometric objects $S$ and a query region $Q$, our 
goal is to identify those objects in $S$ which intersect the 
query region $Q$ by at least a fixed proportion of their original 
size. Two variations of this problem are studied. In the first 
variation the objects in $S$ are line segments and the objective 
is to count the total number of members of $S$ so that their 
intersection with $Q$ is at least a given proportion of their size. 
Here $Q$ can be an axis-parallel rectangle or a slab of arbitrary 
orientation. In the second variation, $S$ is a polygon and $Q$ is 
an axis parallel rectangle. 
The problem is to report the area of the intersection between the 
polygon $S$ and a query rectangle $Q$. 
%Here we have studied two subcases depending on whether $S$ is a 
%convex or a monotone polygon.


\section{Introduction}
In a geometric range searching problem, a set of geometric objects 
$S$ are given, such as points, lines, circles, 
or boxes, and the query is with respect to another well-defined 
geometric object $Q$. The objective is to identify all 
elements in $S$ contained within the query region $Q$. 
Traditionally, preprocessing schemes are developed to build a data 
structure so that queries can be answered efficiently. Over past four decades 
several variants of range searching problems have been studied depending 
on the complexity of the objects in $S$, the 
query region $Q$, and the query requirements. 

In this paper, we address a different variation of this problem, 
called \emph{partial enclosure range searching (\PERS{})}. To the 
best of our knowledge, this problem is not studied previously. In 
this setting, the goal is to identify, for a given query region 
$Q$, all objects in $S$ that satisfy the \emph{partial enclosure 
property}. An object in $S$ is said to satisfy the \emph{partial 
enclosure property} if at least some fixed proportion of the object
(with respect to its length, area, volume) must be inside the query 
region $Q$. 

This problem was inspired by the use of Microsoft 
OneNote. Using a digital pen, OneNote can be used much like a paper 
notebook, allowing the user to add handwriting, diagrams, equations, 
etc. to a page. 
Figure~\ref{fig:intro:onenote} shows some handwritten notes, and a 
diagram which has been partially selected. Here the horizontal 
line segments of the diagram are not entirely enclosed by 
the selection tool, but they appear as part of the set of selected 
items. This behaviour of selecting partially enclosed objects is 
described in a patent \cite{lassoselect}. 
With the rising popularity of touch and pen-enabled devices, this 
need is likely to increase. Although the problems that we will 
examine take place in simpler settings, we will nevertheless develop 
an understanding of the major challenges of this problem domain, as 
well as some techniques for addressing them.

The paper proposes algorithms for the following variations of 
the partial enclosure range searching problem.  
\begin{description}
\item[\PERS{} - Partial enclosure range searching:] Here $S$ 
is given as a set of line segments, and the query object $Q$ 
is an axis-parallel rectangle or a slab bounded by two parallel 
lines of arbitrary orientation. The objective is to count 
the number of objects in $S$ that partially/fully lie in $Q$. We have 
considered different combinations depending on the orientation 
of the line segments in $S$ and the orientation of the 
rectangle/slab $Q$.
\item[\PEAC{} - Partial enclosure area computation:] Here $S$ 
is a monotone or arbitrary polygon, and $Q$ is an axis-parallel 
rectangle or slab respectively. The objective is to compute the 
area of the region $S\cap Q$. 
\end{description}

Table~\ref{tab:contributions} gives a broad overview of the 
proposed results in this paper. Here, `AP' is used for {\it 
Axis-Parallel}, `AO' for {\it Arbitrary Orientation}, and 
`P' for {\it Polygon}.

The next four sections of the paper cover partial enclosure 
range searching queries on successively more sophisticated 
geometric objects. In Section \ref{prelim}, we state some 
preliminaries. Section~\ref{:rectangles} focuses on the 
partial enclosure range counting problem when the objects 
are line segments and the query region is an axis-parallel 
rectangle, Section~\ref{:slabs} considers the counting problem 
in the same environment where the query region is an 
arbitrary-oriented slab. Section 
\ref{:monotonep} considers the partial enclosure area 
computation problem in polygons. Finally, we 
conclude in Section~\ref{conclusion}, where we summarize our 
contributions and future work.
